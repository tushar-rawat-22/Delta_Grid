# DeltaGrid Architecture State

## Shadow Research Control Plane

Mission 58 adds the Shadow Research Control Plane.

It orchestrates:

1. public data orchestration
2. shadow ledger tracking updater
3. shadow tracking performance reporter
4. shadow tracking alert and invalidation router
5. documentation registry

## Safety Boundary

The control plane is not an execution engine.

It cannot:

- place orders
- sign transactions
- use private keys
- deploy capital
- enable live trading

## Multi-Strategy Research Factory Layer

Mission 59 adds a strategy research factory layer.

Inputs:

- historical public funding rates
- historical public basis observations

Outputs:

- strategy registry
- strategy candidates
- promotion shortlist
- watchlist
- rejection reasons
- factory report

Safety boundary:

- this layer produces research candidates only
- it does not place trades
- it does not allocate capital
